### Set up
- We used data from the yelp challenge, however we only really worked with the review file: review.json: 3.6G: 4736897 reviews.

#### Horrible
- appeared on 78181 lines
- seems to indicate low scores
- few (I only saw 1) of 4 stars

#### Scrumptious
- appeared on 6558 lines
- seems to indicate high scores
- Mostly 5's and 4's and few 3's

### Processing Data
- I usually have lots of things running on my computer so I first tried without closing anything and could only get to about 150,000 before it got too slow to continue with only about 15% idle space.
- After closing nearly every program I had running I was about to get to 450,000 before I had about 17% idle space remaining so I quit trying.
- I noticed that there would be a peak and then it would go down again and then would have another shorter peak, however if you couldn't make it over the initial peak nothing would work, the measurements above are taken at that first peak point.

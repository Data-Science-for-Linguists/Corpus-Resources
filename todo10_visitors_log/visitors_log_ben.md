Your project is looking impressive and very thorough. I see you added a search function which is neat. Expanding it to work for all searches seems like a good goal to have.

Reading through your goals I wasn't sure what your goal with the bigrams you are collecting was. What analysis is being performed on them to decide if a smaller bundle is part of a larger one or distinct?

# Visitors log, Ben's Project

Ben's class project is entitled '*An analysis of spoken lexical bundles in the Pitt ELI corpus*'.
It can be found here: https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Bigram-analysis-of-writing-from-the-ELI.git

## Andrew Ryan
Your project is looking impressive and very thorough. I see you added a search function which is neat. Expanding it to work for all searches seems like a good goal to have.

Reading through your goals I wasn't sure what your goal with the bigrams you are collecting was. What analysis is being performed on them to decide if a smaller bundle is part of a larger one or distinct?

## Alicia Sigmon

1. I had never seen anything about Pointwise Mutual Information before, and it seems very helpful!
You use a lot of analysis techniques that seem very sophistocated, and I think your project will turn out very well.


2. Your plan and process are very thorough and well organized, making your project easier to follow and understand!
The markdown cells throughout your code helped a lot.
I would double check your user_df dataframe, because it is currently full of mostly NaN values.

1. I really like how your project plan is organized, and how you labelled your revised plan and dated it. It's super clear and straightforward. I also think looking at lexical bundles is a really cool way to analyze this dataset. Like Andrew said, your search function looks really helpful.

2. Your cleanup really made the dataset easier to understand! For example when I looked at your first dataframes I was thinking "...what is Arabic German?". Your simple clean up techniques (changing to Arabic;German) helped with understanding.

Very well organized and easy to follow.  Dataframes looks nice, the data set looks like it comes with a lot of attributes (I think you said 29 columns in user_df?)

## Andrew Ryan
Your project is looking impressive and very thorough. I see you added a search function which is neat. Expanding it to work for all searches seems like a good goal to have.

Reading through your goals I wasn't sure what your goal with the bigrams you are collecting was. What analysis is being performed on them to decide if a smaller bundle is part of a larger one or distinct?

## Alicia Sigmon

1. I had never seen anything about Pointwise Mutual Information before, and it seems very helpful! 
You use a lot of analysis techniques that seem very sophistocated, and I think your project will turn out very well.


2. Your plan and process are very thorough and well organized, making your project easier to follow and understand! 
The markdown cells throughout your code helped a lot.
I would double check your user_df dataframe, because it is currently full of mostly NaN values.

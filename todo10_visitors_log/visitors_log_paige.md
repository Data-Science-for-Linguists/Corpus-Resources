#### Margaret was here:
- Your data cleaning looks like it took a really long time and it is really nicely done.
- Your project is really easy to read and follow as well, keep it up.  
- Your progress report is also very clear on the progress you made and what your goals were each time you worked on your project.
  - The only thing I would change is have the most recent changes first, so flip the order of your progress report? (correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's how it is supposed to be, right?)
- I'm very interested as to where you're going from here, when you move on to your analysis stage. How exactly are you planning on pulling out gendered call-outs? I know you were talking to me a little bit about this in class, and how the nltk functions that you're using will remove that stuff and you have to find a way to keep it.
- You might want to take a look at the sentiment intensity analyzer (it is an nltk function)
  - from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
  - while this won't help you with your specific goal, it might be an interesting thing to take a look at in general.

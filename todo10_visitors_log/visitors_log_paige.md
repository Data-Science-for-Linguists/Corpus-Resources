#### Margaret was here:
- Your data cleaning looks like it took a really long time and it is really nicely done.
- Your project is really easy to read and follow as well, keep it up.
- Your progress report is also very clear on the progress you made and what your goals were each time you worked on your project.
  - The only thing I would change is have the most recent changes first, so flip the order of your progress report? (correct me if I'm wrong but I believe that's how it is supposed to be, right?)
- I'm very interested as to where you're going from here, when you move on to your analysis stage. How exactly are you planning on pulling out gendered call-outs? I know you were talking to me a little bit about this in class, and how the nltk functions that you're using will remove that stuff and you have to find a way to keep it.
- You might want to take a look at the sentiment intensity analyzer (it is an nltk function)
  - from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer
  - while this won't help you with your specific goal, it might be an interesting thing to take a look at in general.

- Your project is really interesting and easy to follow
- The NER Tree is one of the coolest things that I didn't even know existed in Python! I will definitely want to use that in the future!
- All of your files are well laid out and comprehensive
- I honestly can't think of anything that I would add to this because your data collection and formatting was so thorough
  - Perhaps you might want to list what all the parts of speech the NER Tree is showing are just in case somebody who isn't familiar with the annotation (this is probably unnecessary though due to the fact that mostly linguists will see the data)

- It looks like you put a lot of work into building the NER tree, and it seems like a really useful tool. It looks like a great way to organize a lot of useful information, though it also seems error-prone, especially when it has to deal with proper nouns. You pointed out several instances in your files when it didn't handle peoples' titles correctly. I also noticed some odd entries in your set of people names (e.g. "Lake Erie", "Espanol").
- Though it isn't directly related to your goal, you might want to look into using machine learning. A lot of politicians seem to have their own "talking points" that they repeat frequently, so it would be interesting to see if any machine learning algorithms could pick up on them.

#### Dan's Visit

#### Something you learned
  - Really interesting work with the NER trees! I didn't know you could do that.
  - The project is really clearly laid out and easy to understand!

#### Something else that came to your mind.
  - Some of the outputs are a bit long.
  - When you say you're going to "see if there is a difference in the way females and males are referred to", will this entail building a model to classify if a referral is female or male? Interested in what your next steps are.

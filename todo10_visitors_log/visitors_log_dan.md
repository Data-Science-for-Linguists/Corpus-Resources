# Dan's Visitor Log
Check out my document clustering project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/dan_project)


**Ben's visit - Nov 6, 2017**  

*Something I learned from you project:*  
-	‘Measuring semantic distances’ sounds like something I should know about, but in reality I’m ignorant other than the general concept. I will be very interested to see how this gets measured and would love to ‘borrow’ the code for my own future projects if possible.  
-	How to read-in and use json files – very useful  

*Something else that came to my mind.*  
-	Looks like an ambitious project!  
-	For English teachers with poor coding skills (like me), adding a bit more descriptive prose to your coding would be very helpful. Perhaps it’s not necessary for most people who will see it though.

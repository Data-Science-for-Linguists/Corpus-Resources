# Dan's Visitor Log
Check out my document clustering project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/dan_project)

**Alicia's visit - Nov 15, 2017**

*Something I learned from your project:*  
- 	I didn't previously know how to make the clustering diagram, and also it was interesting how you read in the data files of the wiki articles.

*Something that came to mind*
- 	The visualization is good, but I recommend adding a markdown cell to explain what the clustering does and maybe a key for what the colors symbolize.


**Ben's visit - Nov 6, 2017**  

*Something I learned from your project:*  
-	‘Measuring semantic distances’ sounds like something I should know about, but in reality I’m ignorant other than the general concept. I will be very interested to see how this gets measured and would love to ‘borrow’ the code for my own future projects if possible.  
-	How to read-in and use json files – very useful  

*Something else that came to my mind.*  
-	Looks like an ambitious project!  
-	For English teachers with poor coding skills (like me), adding a bit more descriptive prose to your coding would be very helpful. Perhaps it’s not necessary for most people who will see it though.  

** Chris's Visit Nov 7 2017**

*Something I learned*
- I learned from your code how to go about scraping and organizing your data using bs4 and requests librariies

*Something that came to mind*
- The visuals in your clustering.ipynb look awesome, looking forward to the final result and analysis  

** Andrew's Visit - 11/16 **

- My project is currently under the MIT license, but after reading your License Notes, I may make the switch to a GNU GPLv3 license as well.

- Looking at your clustering notebook, it's nice to see a plot to show it working. It might be nice to add some markdown cells that explain the meaning of the clusters.

# Dan's Visitor Log
Check out my document clustering project [here](https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/dan_project)

**Alicia's visit - Nov 15, 2017**

*Something I learned from your project:*  
- 	I didn't previously know how to make the clustering diagram, and also it was interesting how you read in the data files of the wiki articles.

*Something that came to mind*
- 	The visualization is good, but I recommend adding a markdown cell to explain what the clustering does and maybe a key for what the colors symbolize.


**Ben's visit - Nov 6, 2017**  

*Something I learned from your project:*  
-	‘Measuring semantic distances’ sounds like something I should know about, but in reality I’m ignorant other than the general concept. I will be very interested to see how this gets measured and would love to ‘borrow’ the code for my own future projects if possible.  
-	How to read-in and use json files – very useful  

*Something else that came to my mind.*  
-	Looks like an ambitious project!  
-	For English teachers with poor coding skills (like me), adding a bit more descriptive prose to your coding would be very helpful. Perhaps it’s not necessary for most people who will see it though.  

** Chris's Visit Nov 7 2017**

*Something I learned*
- I learned from your code how to go about scraping and organizing your data using bs4 and requests librariies

*Something that came to mind*
- The visuals in your clustering.ipynb look awesome, looking forward to the final result and analysis  

** Andrew's Visit - 11/16 **

- My project is currently under the MIT license, but after reading your License Notes, I may make the switch to a GNU GPLv3 license as well.

- Looking at your clustering notebook, it's nice to see a plot to show it working. It might be nice to add some markdown cells that explain the meaning of the clusters.

**Paige's Visit - 11/20**

*Something I learned*
- Your cluster visualization is really cool! gensim's keywords method is also super nifty. I'll have to try that out!

*Something that came to mind*
- Your repo has lots of great stuff in there, but it seems like it could be a little hard to find what you're looking for in it because it looks like you still have old code and data in there from an older version of your project plan. If you wanted, it might help with presentation a bit if in your README you gave a small description of your notebooks, your data folders, what that pickle file contains, etc.

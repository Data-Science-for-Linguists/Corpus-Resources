# Visitor's log: Comparing Native and Non-native Spoken English
https://github.com/Data-Science-for-Linguists/Native_and_Non-native_English


### Dan's Visit, 11/6/2017
#### Something you learned
  - VOICE and BNC are both nice datasets.
  - I agree that looking into whether the participants' speech changed when they were conversing with native speakers could be really interesting.
  - I've only parsed HTML with BeautifulSoup, not XML, so that was new.
  - Nice work with the data processing!

#### Something else that came to your mind.
  - Can you train a binary classifier for native vs non-native speakers? That could be interesting. You could feed in features that you mention like average utterance length, common words, bigrams, stop words, etc. Might give some insight into what is better at distinguishing between native and non-native speakers!

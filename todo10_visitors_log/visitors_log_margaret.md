## Kyle's Visit
### 11/6/2017
- I think your project is really interesting and the way you have it laid out right now makes it easy to follow
- I also think that it's great that you're expanding on the tweepy practice we did in class! I would have loved to have had more time to delve into it and I can't wait to see what other results you get!
- It's really interesting that cats get retweeted much more than dogs do despite being posted much less often
- One thought from me is that under the neologisms you might want to also include things like 'kitty', 'doggy', 'kitten', or 'puppy'
   - If there's time, you might also want to try adding adjectives to the hashtags like FunnyCat or something like that. I feel like a lot of cat pictures or videos that are funny cat videos
- Please update the README

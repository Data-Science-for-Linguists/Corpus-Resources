### Katherine's visit, 11/7/2017
I thought that what you found about the number of retweets and favorites for cats and dogs was interesting. It seems kind of strange that cat posts are more likely to be retweeted, and dog posts are more likely to be favorites. Some of the time zones that came up were also interesting (Abu Dhabi, Tunis, Caracas, etc.). 
I think that looking more into the different neologisms could be interesting. If it's possible to get tweets that are about dogs or cats, you could maybe try looking into how often words like "doggo" and "kitteh" are used in these posts. You could also use time zones/locations to see if these words are used more frequently in certain regions.

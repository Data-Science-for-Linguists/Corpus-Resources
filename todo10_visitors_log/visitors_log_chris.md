**Ben's visit - Nov 6, 2017**  
*Something I learned from you project:*  
-	Using trees and roots plus a set variable to go through a folder of XML files and populate an empty dataframe you created. Impressive!  

*Something else that came to my mind.*  
-	Very clear descriptions of progress and what you’re doing – much appreciated!  
-	VADER is an odd name for a sentiment package  

**Alicia's visit - Nov 6, 2017**

*Something I learned from you project:*  
- The filter for the tokenization was very elegant and impressive. You did a good job of
cleaning up your data for your future analysis. I did not think to filter through my texts
like this, and I think it is a helpful technique for tokenization.

*Something else that came to mind:*  

- I didn't see anywhere how often people were mentioned or if some people were mentioned significantly more times than others.
I'm not sure if this is necessary for your data, and also references to people might not be written exactly the same way, so I'm not sure
if it'd even be possible to compile that information for this project.

**Andrew's Visit - 11/16**
- It's cool to see your using NLTK's SenimentAnalyzer, I'm considering using it for my project and it's helpful to see what you've done with it. What is the COM value that your Analyzer finds? I may try using this package in my project.

- It might be helpful to find a way to break down the sentiment analysis process. You say the values don't seem quite right. If there is a way to see how the analyzer is working, it might help get you the scores you desire.

**Paige's Visit - 11/20**
- This is a really cool project and kiiiinda similar to what I'm looking at! Looking at your data samples, I'm seeing that I really wish my data had been xmls. Your data processing looks, like Alicia said, elegant and simple. Nice job!

- You have your own system that works well, but if you wanted you could try out NLTK's Named Entity Recognition chunker! It's what I used to pull out the people in my data.
- I like the format of your project plan!

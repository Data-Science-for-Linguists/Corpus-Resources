**Ben's visit - Nov 6, 2017**  
*Something I learned from you project:*  
-	Using trees and roots plus a set variable to go through a folder of XML files and populate an empty dataframe you created. Impressive!  

*Something else that came to my mind.*  
-	Very clear descriptions of progress and what you’re doing – much appreciated!  
-	VADER is an odd name for a sentiment package  

**Alicia's visit - Nov 6, 2017**

*Something I learned from you project:*  
- The filter for the tokenization was very elegant and impressive. You did a good job of 
cleaning up your data for your future analysis. I did not think to filter through my texts
like this, and I think it is a helpful technique for tokenization.

*Something else that came to mind:*  
- I didn't see anywhere how often people were mentioned or if some people were mentioned significantly more times than others.
I'm not sure if this is necessary for your data, and also references to people might not be written exactly the same way, so I'm not sure 
if it'd even be possible to compile that information for this project.

**Ben's visit - Nov 6, 2017**  
*Something I learned from you project:*  
-	Using trees and roots plus a set variable to go through a folder of XML files and populate an empty dataframe you created. Impressive!  

*Something else that came to my mind.*  
-	Very clear descriptions of progress and what you’re doing – much appreciated!  
-	VADER is an odd name for a sentiment package

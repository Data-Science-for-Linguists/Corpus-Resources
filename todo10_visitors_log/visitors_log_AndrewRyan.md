This is a really interesting project!
1. I think the way you plan to analyze the results of your sentiment analysis is pretty unique. I wouldn't have thought to look if how frequently someone comments affects anything.

2. I know in your README you said you want to look at the relationship between comments and viewership statistics, so I definitely think your sentiment analysis plan is cool. Are you planning on creating/finding training data so you can classify the comments that way, or are you going to take an unsupervised approach? I think the fact that all of the comments your analyzing were made live makes this a pretty cool dataset.

- I didn't know that there were corpora of comments from livestream games. It's an interesting concept!
- I also thought that, as far as analysis goes, you had some really great ideas. Sentiment analysis could be really interesting, especially if you're planning on seeing how users' sentiments change over time. If possible, another thing you could potentially do is see if opinions of the games affect how frequently users play them. Do people who initially write negative comments give the game a chance and continue playing (this could maybe be measured by how often they comment after their initial comments), or do they stop using it immediately? Are these stats different for different games?

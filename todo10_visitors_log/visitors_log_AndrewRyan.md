This is a really interesting project!
1. I think the way you plan to analyze the results of your sentiment analysis is pretty unique. I wouldn't have thought to look if how frequently someone comments affects anything.

2. I know in your README you said you want to look at the relationship between comments and viewership statistics, so I definitely think your sentiment analysis plan is cool. Are you planning on creating/finding training data so you can classify the comments that way, or are you going to take an unsupervised approach? I think the fact that all of the comments your analyzing were made live makes this a pretty cool dataset.

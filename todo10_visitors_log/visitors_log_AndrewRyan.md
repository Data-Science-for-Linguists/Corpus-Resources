This is a really interesting project!
1. I think the way you plan to analyze the results of your sentiment analysis is pretty unique. I wouldn't have thought to look if how frequently someone comments affects anything.

2. I know in your README you said you want to look at the relationship between comments and viewership statistics, so I definitely think your sentiment analysis plan is cool. Are you planning on creating/finding training data so you can classify the comments that way, or are you going to take an unsupervised approach? I think the fact that all of the comments your analyzing were made live makes this a pretty cool dataset.

- I didn't know that there were corpora of comments from livestream games. It's an interesting concept!
- I also thought that, as far as analysis goes, you had some really great ideas. Sentiment analysis could be really interesting, especially if you're planning on seeing how users' sentiments change over time. If possible, another thing you could potentially do is see if opinions of the games affect how frequently users play them. Do people who initially write negative comments give the game a chance and continue playing (this could maybe be measured by how often they comment after their initial comments), or do they stop using it immediately? Are these stats different for different games?

- This is a really interesting topic!
- I agree with Katherine that sentiment analysis would be a good addition to your project. You already have a lot of good ideas with how you're dealing with your data, but I think that would make a great addition if you're not planning on it already.
- I'm curious as to how long in generally takes for someone to "warm-up" to a game on twitch... how do you plan on measuring that?

*Something I learned from your project:*  
- The twitch data is very cool. Nice work with pandas!
*Something that came to mind*
- Sentiment analysis would be very cool. However, generally I've seen sentiment analysis used to determine just positive, neutral, or negative, so I don't completely understand what you mean by "see how the sentiment of chat changes as a game is played over the course of different streams". This sounds really neat, but I would definitely make sure you have a concrete definition of different types of sentiment when you do this. It sounds like you're looking for much more than just positive/neutral/negative.

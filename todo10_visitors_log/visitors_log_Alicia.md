# Visitor Log: Discourse Analysis of the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus Project

## Andrew Ryan
I like how your DataFrames clearly display the relevant info from your data files.

One of your goals is to determine which group is interrupted most in your corpus. I think this is an interesting question. How do you plan to locate interruptions in your corpus? Looking through the files I can see things like laughter marked, but nothing indicating being cut off. Is this something searchable? In addition you discuss the difference in size between the callers and the experts/presenters, but have you considered what the gender makeup of your corpus? That may be important when doing your analysis.

# Visitor Log: Discourse Analysis of the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus Project

## Andrew Ryan
I like how your DataFrames clearly display the relevant info from your data files.

One of your goals is to determine which group is interrupted most in your corpus. I think this is an interesting question. How do you plan to locate interruptions in your corpus? Looking through the files I can see things like laughter marked, but nothing indicating being cut off. Is this something searchable? In addition you discuss the difference in size between the callers and the experts/presenters, but have you considered what the gender makeup of your corpus? That may be important when doing your analysis.

1. This is a cool idea! I like that you've made predictions as to how multiple people involved in the conversation will perform and that you are including the gender data in your analysis.

2. I'm assuming you're going to analyze "funniness" by the [laughter] in the transcripts, but I wasn't quite clear on how interruptions were annotated in the data, so you could maybe describe how you plan to do that more? Other than that your project is very clear.

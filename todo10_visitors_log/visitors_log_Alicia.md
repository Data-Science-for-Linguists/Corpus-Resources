# Visitor Log: Discourse Analysis of the Australian Radio Talkback Corpus Project

## Andrew Ryan
I like how your DataFrames clearly display the relevant info from your data files.

One of your goals is to determine which group is interrupted most in your corpus. I think this is an interesting question. How do you plan to locate interruptions in your corpus? Looking through the files I can see things like laughter marked, but nothing indicating being cut off. Is this something searchable? In addition you discuss the difference in size between the callers and the experts/presenters, but have you considered what the gender makeup of your corpus? That may be important when doing your analysis.

1. This is a cool idea! I like that you've made predictions as to how multiple people involved in the conversation will perform and that you are including the gender data in your analysis.

2. I'm assuming you're going to analyze "funniness" by the [laughter] in the transcripts, but I wasn't quite clear on how interruptions were annotated in the data, so you could maybe describe how you plan to do that more? Other than that your project is very clear.

I like the idea for the project.  It would be interesting to see how someone might control a conversation.  Examining how many utterances a speakers has and how many times they interrupt or are interrupted by another speaker would be interesting.

Your dataframes look nice and well organized.

- I thought that you did a really good job organizing your data frames. I think that the data that I'm working with is somewhat similar to yours, so it was good to see other ways to organize and present spoken data/conversations.
- I don't really know anything about discourse analysis, so I feel that I don't have many suggestions I can make. I think that using the roles of the speakers as a basis for comparison is a great idea, though. Maybe you could see how the conversations change when certain people are participating. For example, you could see if the conversations differ when callers are involved. Does the conversation become more informal, or more friendly/light-hearted (indicated by nonverbal cues, like laughter) when callers are brought onto these shows?

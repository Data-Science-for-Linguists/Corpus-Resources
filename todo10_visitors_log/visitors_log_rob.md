1. You mentioned that you wanted to look at both biased and unbiased subreddits. I think the way you used your hobby subreddits as controls is a really smart idea!

2. It would be interesting if you did sentiment analysis on the comments as well! Then you could do some analysis on what percentage of people commenting in for example The Donald are clearly supportive or not, and then similarly for the other subreddits to see if people comment more in a subreddit for their own political beliefs, or more in subreddits for opposing ones.

- I was thinking the same thing as Paige about the sentiment analysis. I think that would be an interesting addition.
- I think for some of these if you could define a function for it, it would be a lot cleaner. Other than that I think you're looking good.

1. You mentioned that you wanted to look at both biased and unbiased subreddits. I think the way you used your hobby subreddits as controls is a really smart idea!

2. It would be interesting if you did sentiment analysis on the comments as well! Then you could do some analysis on what percentage of people commenting in for example The Donald are clearly supportive or not, and then similarly for the other subreddits to see if people comment more in a subreddit for their own political beliefs, or more in subreddits for opposing ones.

- I was thinking the same thing as Paige about the sentiment analysis. I think that would be an interesting addition.
- I think for some of these if you could define a function for it, it would be a lot cleaner. Other than that I think you're looking good.

- I think that choosing subreddits that allow you to form larger categories was a good idea. Since one of your categories is more specific (politics) and the other is more general (Android, board games, hockey), it would probably be easiest to compare political discussions to more general discussions. Political discussions can get particularly heated, so there are probably a lot of differences between them and other topics. I've also noticed that conversations about professional sports can get pretty intense, too, so it could be interesting to see if the hockey subreddit has any similarities with the political ones. 
- I agree with Margaret that, in the future, you should put repeated code into functions. I think that it would make processing and analyzing the data much less tedious, and the code would be much easier to manage. :)

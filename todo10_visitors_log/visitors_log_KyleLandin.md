### Dan's Visit, 11/6/2017
#### Something you learned 
  - I've never seen a Chinese dataset before. Very cool!
  - I didn't know about `pd.merge`, which will definitely come in handy.

#### Something else that came to your mind.
  - To further verify that you've made the dataframe correctly, maybe you can use some kind of API to convert pinyin to characters or vice versa?
  - When you have 全国 -> quan2guo2, what do the 2s mean?

# Corpus Resources

A **collaborative repo** where everyone has push access. No need to fork! Pull and push directly. 

We will use this repo to practice _true collaboration_, which involves everyone editing a shared text file. That means we have to **deal with conflicts**, head-on: 

- Make sure to study this tutorial: [Version Control with Git Ch.9 Conflicts](http://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/09-conflict/). 

- The tutorial uses `nano` as the text editor. Replace it with your own text editor: `notepad++`, `atom`, etc. 

- Editing the `corpus_tools_list.md` is part of [To-do #7](http://www.pitt.edu/~naraehan/ling1340/todo.html#todo7). Make sure you follow instructions.
